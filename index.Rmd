## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the upcoming Malaysian elections. Making predictions about election outcomes would be cool, but it might also be outside my skill set. I'm particularly interested in exploring the potential effect of a recent law lowering the voting age to 18 on election outcomes, and would look at data sets from youth opinion surveys and state-level elections to explore the role of youth in Malaysian politics.
